# Are You Overspending on SaaS?  Five Ways to Save Big

Many small businesses fall into the trap of paying for **expensive SaaS subscriptions** when cheaper tools provide the same core functionality.  Research shows that costs can spiral as teams sign up for multiple services without a unified strategy【63229005519729†L256-L265】.  Below are five categories where you can cut your monthly spend dramatically by switching to more affordable alternatives.

Pumble offers virtually the same messaging and calling features with a far lower price tag—its **PRO** plan costs **$2.49 per user per month** when billed annually and the **Business** plan costs **$3.99 per user per month**【209881773829465†L467-L489】.  Better still, Pumble’s free tier includes unlimited users and chat history【209881773829465†L438-L462】.  Switching a 10‑person team from Slack Pro to Pumble Pro would save over **$60 per month**.
